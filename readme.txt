
Update replace.js
it is aimed at limiting the replacing actions at the "alt" property of the images 
In such way we can enable the text readers to read math formulas
written in latex notation
all we have to do is having a set of substitutions like these (in italian):
f(          =   f di
^2         =  al quadrato
^           = elevato a
\times   = per
\frac     = frazione
    By vessillo
